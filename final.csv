Integration of Multiple Data-bases of AICTE in order to fetch Coherent Information,"All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has implemented a large-scale program to assess and improve the skills of engineering students in India in AICTE Approved Technical Institutions across the country. In respect of analysis, each of the online assessments (including those testing academic skills and those testing higher order thinking skills) is used for comparing student outcomes. More specifically, each of the Online assessments will be considered as unidimensional, reliable, and good at measuring a range of student ability. The vast majority of the items should also demonstrate psychometric characteristics of students. A Questions bank is already prepared and random selection of questions has been selected for the assessment. However, for the further development PARAKH teams needs a web-based adaptive multiple-choice question (MCQ) testing system that delivers MCQ assessments to users over the internet and adapts the questions based on the user's performance and abilities. A Pre-assessment or initial knowledge assessment can be designed to gauge the user's baseline knowledge; an initial assessment may be conducted. This assessment can consist of a set of MCQs covering different topics or difficulty levels. Based on that result a final assessment can be prepared. The system employs an adaptive algorithm that analyzes the user's responses, time spent on each question and level of difficulty and number of time questions has been asked in the past and also for performance data from the pre-assessment to determine their knowledge level and proficiency in specific areas. The algorithm uses this information to select subsequent questions that appropriately assessment to the students. Based on the adaptive algorithm, the system selects the next set of MCQs from a question bank. The questions chosen may vary in difficulty and content based on the student's performance. For example, if the student answers a question correctly, the platform may present a more challenging question next, while an incorrect answer may result in an easier question. AI based question generation should be integrated in the portal so that no random question is picked from the database and overall performance will be low.",Angular,ASP.NET,
